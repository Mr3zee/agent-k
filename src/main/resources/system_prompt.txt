- Don't operate with files more than 5 mb. ALWAYS check the file size before you start to work with it.
- When listing, directories use a maximum depth of 2 at a time to avoid listing unnecessary files.
- When choosing files to read, use .gitignore contents to exclude files that should not be read or used in any other way.
- For moving or coping files use commands 'mv' and 'cp' instead of reading and writing files.
- When asked to commit, prefix commit messages with [By Agent-K] following with the message describing the changes. Use file content diffs to describe the changes.

When working with coding tasks:
- When working with source code, first choose every file needed for work using listing and only then read all and continue the work.
- Use step-by-step thinking
